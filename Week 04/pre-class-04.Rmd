### Question 1:
Using a loop, print the integers from 1 to 50. 
```{r}
for (i in 1:50){
  print(i)
}
```

### Question 2:
A.  Using a loop, add all the integers between 0 and 1000.
```{r}
sum=0
for (i in 0:1000){
  sum=sum+i
}
sum
```
B. Now, add all the EVEN integers between 0 and 1000 (hint: use seq())
```{r}
sum=0
for (i in seq(from=0, to=1000, by=2)){
  sum=sum+i
}
sum
```

C. Now, repeat A and B WITHOUT using a loop.
```{r}
sum(1:1000)
sum(seq(from=0, to=1000, by=2))
```

### Question 3:

Here is a dataframe of survey data containing 5 questions :

```{r, eval=FALSE}
survey <- data.frame(
                     "participant" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
                     "q1" = c(5, 3, 2, 7, 11, 0),
                     "q2" = c(4, 2, 2, 5, -10, 99),
                     "q3" = c(-4, -3, 4, 2, 9, 10),
                     "q4" = c(-30, 5, 2, 23, 4, 2),
                     "q5" = c(88, 4, -20, 2, 4, 2)
                     )
```
The response to each question should be an integer between 1 and 5. Obviously, we have some bad values in the dataframe. The goal of this problem is to fix them.

A. Using a loop, create a new dataframe called survey.clean where all the invalid values (those that are not integers between 1 and 5) are set to NA.
```{r}
survey.clean <- survey
for (m in 2:6){
  for (n in 1:6){
    if (survey.clean[n,m]<1|survey.clean[n,m]>5){
      survey.clean[n,m]=NA
    }
  }
}
survey.clean
```


B. Now, again using a loop, add a new column to the dataframe called “invalid.answers” that indicates, for each participant, how many bad answers they gave.
```{r}
invalid.answers=rep(0,time=6)
for (m in 1:6) {
  for (n in 2:6){
    if (is.na(survey.clean[m, n])){
      invalid.answers[m]=invalid.answers[m]+1
    }
  }
}
(survey.clean=cbind(survey.clean,invalid.answers))

print(survey.clean)
```
